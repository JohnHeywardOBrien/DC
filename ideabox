- :title: Dream color calibration
  :description: "</br>\r\nHave this become the place where all calibrations are stored\r\n</br>\r\n1.
    Backend: Getting all fields to input to DB\r\n</br>\r\n2. Views: Ask for tag number
    or display all. Display inputs for new calibration. Put all previous calibrations
    for that monitor underneath \r\n</br>\r\n3. DB: SQlite3? Will probably need to
    start with a YAML setup and then move to a true DB schema\r\n</br>\r\n4. Deploy.
    Is this something could live on the network by any chance?"
